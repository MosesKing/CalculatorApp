# Simple Calculator iOS App
This is a simple calculator app I built entirely with SwiftUI. With SwiftUI I was able to make this app with less than 300 lines of code. Amazing right?! 
The calculator found in this repository is complete. From making this application I learned more about Swift5, SwiftUI, and User Interaction and User Experience (UI/UX) when it relates to Neumorphic Design Approaches. 

# The Calculator Itself
Although math-ing two inputs is pretty straightforward I really wanted to learn more about layouts and states and making complex as well as interesting UI. that takes a very simple program and complicates it. 
I learned about making complex and custom layouts using SwiftUI and the neumorphic design approached and additionally I learned about structs and states and binding states within Swift 5. 
 
 # What is Neumorphism? 
 “Neumorphism” is a new slang term in design circles — co-created by Michal Malewicz — which essentially crosses the words “new” and “skeuomorphism”. Essentially, it's a new, minimal way to design with a soft, extruded plastic look. It's almost as if the interface has been vacuum-formed.
