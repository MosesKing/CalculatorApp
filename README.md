# Simple Calculator iOS App
 the calculator is complete. i learned more about SwiftUI and UI/UX Neumorphic Design Approaches. 
 Although math-ing two inputs is pretty straightforward I really wanted to learn more about layouts and states and making complex as well as interesting UI. that takes a very simple program and complicates it. 
 
 
 i learned about complex layouts and neumorphic design approached and additionally I learned about structs and states and binding states within Swift 5.
